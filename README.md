## Structure

- **`syllabus.tex`**: This is the main LaTeX file. It sets up the document style, defines the document title, and imports each syllabus section from the `sections/` directory. It uses information from `config.tex` to specify dynamic content in the document.
- **`config.tex`**: Contains definitions for global parameters such as course number, section, semester, and instructor information. Adjusting the values in `config.tex` will automatically update them throughout the document.
- **`sections/`**: This directory contains separate `.tex` files for each syllabus section:
  - `course_details.tex` – Course information and instructor details.
  - `course_description.tex` – Detailed course description.
  - `prerequisites.tex` – Course prerequisites.
  - `textbooks.tex` – Lists of required and optional textbooks.
  - `grading_statement.tex` – Grading criteria and policies.
  - `learning_outcomes.tex` – Required section on expected learning outcomes.
  - `attendance.tex` – Optional attendance policy.
  - `academic_integrity.tex` – Required academic integrity guidelines.
  - `adastatement.tex` – Recommended ADA compliance statement.
  - `policy_sexual_misconduct.tex` – Required policy on sexual misconduct.
  - `syllabus_change_policy.tex` – Policy on changes to the syllabus.
