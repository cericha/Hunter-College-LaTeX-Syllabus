Bullying, cyberbullying, online hate, intimidation, threats, harassment, and pressure to share schoolwork are all forms of violence. CUNY holds a zero tolerance stance towards all such acts. The University is committed to prevention of any form of bullying, will respond promptly to threats and/or acts, and will protect victims of bullying from retaliation.  As a criminal matter, the New York Attorney General defines cyberbullying as the use of email, websites, instant messaging, chat rooms, text messaging and digital cameras to antagonize and intimidate others. Disrupting a teleconferencing platform (such as Zoom/Skype/Blackboard Collaborate Ultra) is a federal crime.
